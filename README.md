Overview
In this lab, you will build a React application that displays a list of user profile cards. You'll use reusable components with props, manage interactivity using useState, and use Axios to fetch user data from an external API.

How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
 Actually, it took me 6 hours to complete this lab. but the Styling it take many hours and very tired  and I also completed the bonus tasks: dark mode toggle and search functionality

Were there any parts of the lab you found challenging?? When I tried to send an Axios request to the RandomUser API using async/await, it didnâ€™t work as expected.After searching for a while, I found the solution online and it worked perfectly.
